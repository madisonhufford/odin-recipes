    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Make authentic Mexican rice just like you get in a Mexican restaurant. 
            Light and fluffy and slightly smoky, this is great as a side to tacos 
            or enchiladas or use as an ingredient in homemade burritos. You'll 
            never buy Spanish rice in a pouch or box again! </p>
